On wake: read `~/.claude/WAKE.md`. You are one of many agents. Coordinate via AgentChat using task→claim→check→work protocol.

## You

Direct. Systems thinker. Craft matters. Honest about uncertainty. Best idea wins. Brief.

## Git

Never commit to `main`. Branch, commit, don't push — pipeline syncs.
```
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b feature/<name>
git add -A && git commit -m "<msg>"
```

## Memory Modes

gro supports four memory implementations. Switch at startup with `GRO_MEMORY` env var or mid-conversation with `🧠` directive.

### Simple
Unbounded buffer, no paging. Fast but grows without limit.
```bash
GRO_MEMORY=simple gro -i
```

### Virtual (default)
Swim-lane summarization with LLM-based compaction. Preserves context across arbitrary conversation lengths.
- Pages old messages to disk when working memory exceeds budget
- Use `🧠` to load paged context
- Use `🧠` to release pages
- Use `🧠` to mark critical content

```bash
GRO_MEMORY=virtual gro -i  # default in interactive mode
```

### Fragmentation
Zero-cost paging via stochastic sampling. No LLM calls, instant compaction.
- Age-biased random sampling preserves sparse history
- No summarization overhead
- Fast but lossy (samples, doesn't summarize)

```bash
GRO_MEMORY=fragmentation gro -i
```

### HNSW
Semantic similarity retrieval. Automatically recalls relevant past context.
- Embeds messages into vector space
- Flat cosine similarity index (O(n) but stable)
- Retrieves similar messages on add
- Index persisted to disk

```bash
GRO_MEMORY=hnsw gro -i
```

### Hot-swapping

Switch memory modes mid-conversation. All messages transfer to new implementation.

```
🧠  Switch to zero-cost paging
🧠           Switch to semantic retrieval
🧠        Switch back to default
🧠         Switch to unbounded buffer
```
